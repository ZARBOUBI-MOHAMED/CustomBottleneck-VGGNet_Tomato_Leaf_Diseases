To make the CustomBottleneck-VGGNet model accessible and useful for farmers and agricultural professionals, a mobile application was developed using Android Studio. This application enables users to identify tomato diseases in real-time by either using their smartphone camera or selecting images from their gallery.
		 	
The app features a straightforward and intuitive user interface, allowing users to easily capture or upload images of tomato leaves. The disease identification results are displayed instantly on the screen, showing the name of the detected disease along with the analyzed image.
